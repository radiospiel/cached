# The `cached` commandline tool.

..is so easy to use that you can't forget how to do it:

    cached ls
  
runs ls and caches the result for some time. Best use, of course, 
is the web; i.e.

    cached curl -O http://www.theotherside.com/what/why/when

lets theotherside.com's admins sleep safely at night, even if you twiddle with your webcrawler.
